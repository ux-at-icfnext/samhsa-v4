The Resource Center experience was created for programs and centers to house their content and resources. The experience is meant to create a common structure that is easier to manage for both authoring and development, but also to create a consistent user experience. The first two resources making use of this experience are the Evidence Based Practices Resource Center (EBRPC) and Disaster Behavioral Health Information Series (DBHIS). 

The resources for the centers will be made available through global search, and through an internal search in the program area. The program experience consist of both a landing page which list the resources and a detail page which will can more information before directing the user to the resource.
