## Overview of Component Group
The location filter is made using a [multi-level accordion]({{site.url}}multi-level-accordion-filter). But it has some special features to make it usable for housing the longer list items of States and Tribes.

## Design
**Example:**
Here the Location filter is shown in open state

The National Filter is a select toggle. The definition of National is content that contains all of the United States. (This is different than all-states which would be a collection of items from each state.) If the National filter is one, all other filters are grayed out â€” with 0 counts

The States accordion is also shown in open states. Both the States and the Tribes filters have search functionality embed to help the user get quickly to their chosen state or tribe. The items to select are shown using a select toggle. A maximum of 10 are displayed with the ability to then scroll the section. (This treatment works the same across device sizes)
